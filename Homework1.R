##### Question 4 #####
## An election is approaching and the latest poll of 100 people shows that 58 prefer candidate A and 42 prefer candidate B. You are curious about the chances that candidate A will prevail.

##4.1 Before you read the results of the poll, you had not thought much about the chances that candidate A would win (or a priori, you had no information about the probability of success for candidate A). What is the 95% Highest Posterior Density set (HPD set) on the probability that A will win after you have read the results of the poll?




##4.2 Using simulation, compute a 95% credible set for the probability that A will win. How do the two intervals compare?




##4.3 Just to confirm, you poll a second set of 100 randomly chosen persons from the same population. You find that in this second set, 57 prefer candidate A and the rest prefer B. How does the 95% HPD set you computed in part a change?



##4.4 Based on the two surveys, is it reasonable to conclude that the population is evenly divided in terms of preferences for candidates A and B?



##4.5 Based on the two surveys, what is the probability that candidate A will win by at least a 10% margin?
